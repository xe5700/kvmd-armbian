# Hardware for kvmd-armbian project
* A tv box/arm board supports otg feature:
    - Tests on phicomm n1(Amlogic s905d), mxq pro 4k (rk322x), tqc a01(Allwinner H6). 
    - If you are use arm board you can remove gpio patch to enable gpio feature.
* Video capture device:
    - HDMI to USB dongle (30 RMB On taobao, 10$ on aliexpress.)
      cheap hdmi to usb dongle all use physics USB2.0 port, but fake USB3.0(USB 5GBPS, USB3.2GEN1) version supports 720P 60FPS,
      usb 2.0 version only supports 720P 30FPS.
* USB-A to USB-A cable:
    - Recommended cut off usb cable's power line, it might causes otg disconnect.

## Step 1
- Flash armbian debian [Recommended bullseye] for your tv box (If kernel not support otg you should build a kernel enable otg features)
## Step 2
- Modify your dtb file to enable otg feature. Change dr_mode from host to peripheral for otg usb port.
- If you use rk322x (rk3228A rk3228B rk3229) series chipset, you can use dtb/4.4/rk332x-box.dtb 
## Step 3

cd kvmd-armbian
./install.sh
```
(If very slow, you can use install-mirror.sh to boost install speed.)

## Step 4
- running install.sh or install-mirror.sh after reboot os then running again.
- Enjoy

# Tested device
 - Phicomm N1
 - TQC A01 (Ethernet port not working, only support wireless.)
 - RK322x based tvbox (MXQ, V88)
 - S905L2 based tvbox
 - Orange pi zero (tested by @MrSuicideParrot)
